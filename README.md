# DiMu 💰 📔- Women Financial Literacy Helper Bot

[Microsoft Hack Together: The Power Platform AI Global Hack](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/hack-together-powerplatform-ai/) is a global online hackathon (September 14-28, 2023)🌍. Where you can learn, experiment, and get hands-on experience with the new Copilot and AI features in the Power Platform 💻. 

The goal of Hack Together is to create solutions on the Power Platform that leverage one or more Copilot and AI features. Our solution - *DiMu* is a conversational assistant 🤖 created with Power Virtual Agents' Copilot and Generative AI Capabilites.

## Motivation

Women have less exposure to financial literacy, are paid less than men and live longer. So, it is crucial for women to be sufficiently financially literate to manage the financial risks they face.

## Project Description

**Di** (*dinheiro - money*) **Mu** (*mulher - woman*) is a simple chatbot capable of answering questions related to personal finance and money. The system's knowledge base are websites about financial literacy in general and targeted to women. With DiMu we expect to contribute to the democratization of financial literacy, enabling women to access information about finances, empowering them to choose and access appropriate financial services and products and take control of their money.
